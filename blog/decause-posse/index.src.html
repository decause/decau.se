<h1>When last we left our hero...</h1>
<p>The year was 2015... Like most authors who revisit their previous works, I do <strong>NOT</strong> super-enjoy reading much of what I wrote way back then. For the sake of contuity, however, I am compelled to regenerate and redeploy these past posts for posterity sakes.</p>
<p>Apologies/Congratulations.</p>
<p>Going forward, this site will serve as a vehicle to explore joining the new and exciting frontiers of the <a target="_blank" href="https://indieweb.org">Indieweb</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>.</p>
<p>The IndieWeb resonating principle of "POSSE": <a target="_blank" href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">Publish On Your Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere</a>.</p>
